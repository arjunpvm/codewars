# CODEWARS

I practice solving coding problems in [codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

I solve as many problems as I can while I am not working on any project so that I code few lines everyday.

### KYU:
* Kyu is the level of difficulty of a program
* level 8 is the easiest and level 1 is the hardest
